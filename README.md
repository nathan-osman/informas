## Informas

Want to enable multiple users to tweet from a group of Twitter accounts without sharing login credentials? Informas is here to help. The dashboard allows administrators to grant access to individual accounts on a per-user basis.

### Features

- Add any number of Twitter accounts to Informas
- Grant access to accounts on a per-user basis
- Queue tweets for sending at a later date
- Hold tweets for administrator approval

### Building

The only requirements for building the application are [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and `make`. In the directory that contains the source code, run the following command:

    make

That's it &mdash; you can run the application with:

    dist/informas
